    "Unlike many approaches that predict game outcomes based on historical team data, this approach will be developed with the following key insights:\n",
    "- Individual player statistics provide significant information about overall team performance.\n",
    "- The absence of a teamâ€™s best player (e.g., due to injury) must be accounted for, as it can significantly impact the predicted probabilities.\n",
    "- The model will undergo a pre-training phase using pre-game winning odds as the target outcome rather than the actual game result. This is because basketball, as a sport involving human factors, introduces an inherent irreducible error in predictions. Leveraging pre-game odds can help the model identify more meaningful patterns in the data."
